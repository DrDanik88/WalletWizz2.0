## Description

This project is a dynamic full-stack application adhering to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, leveraging JavaScript for both its backend and frontend components. It incorporates the Plaid API for seamless financial data integration. The backend is powered by Node.js, ensuring robust server-side functionality, while the front end is developed using JavaScript to create an interactive user experience. Additionally, the application is deployed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces and enhancing its responsiveness and interactivity. For database management, it utilizes Mongoose, an object data modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, along with GraphQL, a query language for APIs. This combination allows for efficient data storage, retrieval, and manipulation, ensuring smooth and scalable database operations. This comprehensive setup provides a versatile financial application with a seamless user interface and efficient data handling.

### Requirements

```
Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.

Use react as the templating engine.

Use Mongo Atlas and Mongoose for the database.

Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.

Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed.

Have a polished UI.

Be responsive.

Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.

Include authentication (express-session and cookies).

Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables
